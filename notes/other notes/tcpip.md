# What is Internet Protocol Suite(IPS) and TCP/IP

### 1. Summary of Internet protocol suite[^1] :

The internet protocol suite is the **conceptual model** and set of communications protocols used in the internet and similar computer networks. It is commonly known as **TCP/IP** because the fundamental protocols in the suite are the **Transmission Control Protocol(TCP)** and **Internet Protocol(IP)**.

The internet protocol suite provides **end-to-end data communication**[^2] specifying[^3] how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received. This functionality is organized into four abstraction layers, which classify all related protocols according to the scope of networking involved. It's implementation is a **protocol stack**[^4].

From lowest to highest, the layers are the link layer, the internet layer, the transport layer, and the application layer.

The technical standards underlying the internet protocol suite and its constituent protocols are maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF), the Internet protocols suite predates the Open system interconnection（ **OSI** [^5]）reference model, a more comprehensive reference framework for general networking systems.
